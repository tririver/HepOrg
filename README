* Introduction:

** Heporg is a manager for high energy physics references
   - heporg downloads pdf file from arxiv.org or inspirehep.net
   - heporg generates a readable pdf file name (author_arxivNumber.pdf)
   - heporg generates .org files for storing paper information, 
     including author, abstract, journal, etc



* INSTALL (only tested on Linux):

** Download the package (preferably using git as follows:)

   git clone git@github.com:tririver/HepOrg.git

** run setup.sh (you may want to have a read before running it)


* Usage:

** Heporg is recommended to be used together with a Firefox addon
   "viewsourcewith", use settings -> new, enter editor path as
   (path to the package)/heporg.py

** Then at the arxiv abstract page (http://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxx)
   click the viewsourcewith icon. This click will
   - generate a record at dir_prefix/org/toread.org
   - download the pdf file to dir_prefix/pdf/author_arxivNum.pdf

** (Optional) If you want to generate .org file with an alternative name, 
   pass a parameter to heporg.py. In viewsourcewith, the setting is:
   (setting -> new or edit) Parameters: classic $f
   where the tag name 'classic' can be replaced with any name you like.
   Heporg support multiple tags, each tag is a standalone file.

** The .org file is text format thus one can use any editor to view.
   However, emacs is recommended because the .org file is formatted
   according to the emacs "org-mode". This is actually the original
   motivation to write the present software.

** Alternatively (without viewsourcewith), 
   one can save the source of the webpage, 
   and in a terminal type "./heporg.py file.htm", 
   or "./heporg.py tag_name file.htm" to do the same thing.

** Part of the code can be used as parsers of arxiv.org and inspirehep.net,
   to generate other types of outputs (e.g. SQL type, but currently I don't
   have a motivation to write a SQL frontend. Text file + grep works well 
   for me).



* Mechanism:

** heporg.py is the main program.

** parsers.py are parsers for the htm file.

** org_fmt.py format the .org file
