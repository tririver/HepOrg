* Introduction:

** Heporg is a manager for high energy physics references
   - heporg downloads pdf file from arxiv.org or inspirehep.net
   - heporg generates a readable pdf file name (author_arxivNumber.pdf)
   - heporg generates .org files for storing paper information, 
     including author, abstract, journal, etc



* INSTALL (only tested on linux):

** Download the package (preferably using git as follows:)

   git clone git@github.com:tririver/HepOrg.git

** run setup.sh (you may want to have a read before running it)


* Usage:

** Heporg is recommended to be used together with a firefox addon
   "viewsourcewith", use settings -> new, enter editor path as
   (path to the package)/arxiv_toread.py

** Then at the arxiv abstract page (http://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxx)
   click the viewsourcewith icon. This click will
   - generate a record at dir_prefix/org/toread.org
   - download the pdf file to dir_prefix/pdf/author_arxivNum.pdf

** The .org file is text format thus one can use any editor to view.
   However, emacs is recommended because the .org file is formatted
   according to the emacs "org-mode"

** Alternatively (without viewsourcewith), 
   one can save the source of the webpage, 
   and in a terminal type ./arxiv_toread.py file.htm to do the same thing.

** Part of the code can be used as parsers of arxiv.org and inspirehep.net,
   to generate other types of outputs



* Mechanism:

** [arxiv, inspire]_[toread, classical, useful].py are simple scripts
   easily callable by "viewsourcewith"

** [arxiv, inspire]_parser.py are parsers for the htm file.

** refio.py generate formatted org file, with the help of org_fmt.py
